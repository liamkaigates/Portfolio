        <h1>Hi! My name is Liam Gates. I'm a software developer.</h1>
        <p>
            I am currently studying computer science at UMass Amherst. I currently have
            experience with web design (HTML, CSS, & JS), AI (Python), and systems
            (C/C++). In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, violin, and chess.
